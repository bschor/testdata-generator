# testdata-generator

Tired of using an endpoint for tiny test data? This will be your module!

This is just a test and *not* ready for use (or super boring to use).
Currently only my test project for JSR.

## Usage
```javascript
import * as mod from "@laura/testdata-generator";
mod.printHero();
```

## Types
```javascript
type Hero = {
    name: string;
    description: string;
}
```
